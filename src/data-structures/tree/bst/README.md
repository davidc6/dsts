# Binary search tree

## Time complexity (balanced)

- Insertion
  - Anywhere else - O(log n)
- Deletion
  - At beginning - O(log n)
- Read / search
  - At beginning - O(log n)

## Space compexity

0(n)

### notes

* Comparison is on primitive data types only for now
* Why not just use arrays? Arrays have to be sorted first
* Same problems apply to linked list same problem

Implementation

[x] - leaf node
[x] - one child
[x] - two children
